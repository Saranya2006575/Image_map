    <p>Garlands were historically purely secular at first, sought for their fragrance and beauty and used for decorating houses, roads, and streets.[5] It is eventually applied to Hindu deities as an important and traditional role in every festival where these garlands are made using different fragrant flowers (often jasmine) and leaves.[6] Both fragrant and non-fragrant flowers and religiously-significant leaves are used to make garlands to worship Hindu deities.
