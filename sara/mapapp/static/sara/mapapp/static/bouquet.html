<p style= "font-size:larger";> flower bouquet is a collection of flowers in a creative arrangement. Flower bouquets can be arranged
     for the decor of homes or public buildings or may be handheld. Several popular shapes and styles classify handheld bouquets, including nosegay,
    crescent, and cascading bouquets. Flower bouquets are often given for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries or funerals. They are also used
    extensively in weddings and at the Olympic Medal Ceremonies. Bouquets arranged in vases or planters for home decor can be placed in traditional or modern styles.
     According to the culture, symbolism may be attached to the types of flowers used.
