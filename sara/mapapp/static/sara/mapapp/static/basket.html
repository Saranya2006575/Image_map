        <p style="font-size: larger;"> flower basket can be a great gift for a wedding or a birthday â€“ flowers are already in the water and they do not need a vase! Every flower basket tells a unique story, tailored to suit any occasion.
            Therefore, flowers are an essential part of our lives. They are responsible for bringing happiness in our lives and making our surrounding environment a prettier place to live in. Thus, we must all plant flowers at homes and in our neighbourhood to beautify the place and bring happiness and joy for everyone passing by
            They can also be used to hold dried flowers or potpourri, adding a lovely fragrance to any room. In addition to being used for flowers, brass flower baskets can also be used for other decorative purposes. They can be filled with decorative stones or marbles, or used to hold small trinkets or keepsakes.    </p>
